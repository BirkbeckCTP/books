# books
This plugin allows for the publication of Books within the Janeway ecosystem.

This is not a comprehensive platform for the production of books and if you are interested in that you should investigate the likes of RUA, Editoria or OMP.

To install:

- Clone the respository into `src/plugins/`
- Run `python src/manage.py install_plugins`
- Run `python src/manage.py migrate`
- Restart the server
